# Cascade · Monitoring

**Which transaction-monitoring scenario suffices, at which threshold, measured on your own
dispositioned alerts.** Nothing of yours goes up: this tool downloads nothing, your alerts
and your transactions stay on your machine.

Transaction monitoring raises alerts; most of them are false, each one costs analyst
minutes, and nobody can say why a scenario sits at its threshold except "that is the
vendor's setting". This tool measures it: several scenarios, from a bare amount to the
deviation from a peer profile, are replayed over the alerts your analysts already
dispositioned, each alert rebuilt into a thirty-day case from your own transactions, and
each scenario × threshold cell is read for recall on confirmed suspicious cases, false-alert
rate on benign ones and alerts per thousand accounts — with its count and its interval, or
not at all.

No real transaction is public, so the public record of this tool is entirely written and
generated, and says so: cases we wrote (with their benign look-alikes) and seeded variants,
kept apart. The measure that counts is yours, on your machine.

It is the third tool of the Cascade suite, after [cascade-routing](https://github.com/ArslaneSempai-ui/cascade-routing)
(which extraction tier suffices per field) and [cascade-screening](https://github.com/ArslaneSempai-ui/cascade-screening)
(which name matcher, at which threshold). Same method, same seal, same key.

<!-- figures:commandes -->
| Command | What it does, in the order that makes sense |
|---|---|
| `npm ci --ignore-scripts` | install exactly the versions the lockfile pins, and run no install script from any dependency — the only command that needs the network: this tool downloads nothing else, ever |
| `npm run test` | types, the README blocks, the licence inventory, and the suite — start here; it runs with the network cut |
| `npm run measure [-- --yes-overwrite]` | the public measure: every scenario at every threshold on cases we wrote (benign look-alikes included) plus declared generated variants, sealed into `releve-public.json` and readable in `RELEVE-PUBLIC.md` — no real transaction is public, and the record says so; it refuses to overwrite a sealed one without the flag |
| `npm run measure:yours -- --alerts=<csv> --transactions=<csv> [--volume=N]` | your own dispositioned alerts, rebuilt into thirty-day cases from your transactions: recall on confirmed suspicious cases and false-alert rate on benign ones per scenario and threshold, with n and interval; a sealed record and a report beside your file, never a value of yours |
| `npm run optimise -- --from=<record> --recall=<min>` | the frontier: fewest alerts with the recall lower bound held, or `--alert-budget=<N>` for the highest bounded recall under a monthly alert budget |
| `npm run sceller -- <record.json>` | seal a record: the fingerprint that makes a silently edited measurement fail loudly — the same fingerprint as cascade-routing |
| `npm run verify -- <report>` | check that a report was issued by the holder of the suite's public key, `cle-publique.pem`, without asking us |
| `npm run licences` | regenerate `LICENCES.md`, the licence of every shipped package — `--check` fails the suite when the table drifts |

## Requirements

Node 24 or newer, on **macOS or Linux**. Windows has not been tested and is not claimed.

## What leaves your machine

Nothing. This tool has no list to download and no model to fetch: every command runs with
the network cut, and a test walks the sources so that no module ever grows a network call
(`src/frontiere.test.ts`).

## What is measured, assumed, synthetic

Every rate in a report carries its `n` and its 95 % Wilson interval. The scales that turn
an amount or a count into a score, the cash reporting threshold, analyst minutes per alert
and analyst cost are **assumed** and declared in `src/assumptions.ts`. The public record is
**written and generated**: cases we authored and seeded variants, measured apart, never
merged into anything measured on your data. Below five confirmed suspicious cases, no
recall is quoted: the report says so.

## Seals and signatures

Records are sealed (`npm run sceller`) with the same fingerprint as cascade-routing, and
reports are verified against the same public key, [`cle-publique.pem`](cle-publique.pem),
with `npm run verify`.

<!-- figures:tests -->
**79 tests** across 9 files, counted from the sources rather than typed here.

## Licence

The same public licence as cascade-routing: non-commercial use without limit of time, a
thirty-day evaluation on your own records for organisations, a commercial licence for
production. See [LICENSE](LICENSE) and [LICENCES.md](LICENCES.md).
