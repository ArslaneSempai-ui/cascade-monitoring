# Cascade Monitoring — the public measure

**Provenance**: no real transaction is public: written and generated, and it says so. Cases written by this repository (archetypes of
suspicion and their benign look-alikes) plus seeded, structure-preserving variants,
measured APART and never merged. Commit `2fa9f51`, 2026-09-05. Sealed as
`releve-public.json`; every rate below carries its n and its 95 % Wilson interval, and
the FULL threshold grid (51 steps) lives in the JSON — this page shows
8 declared columns of it. The record also carries the declared scales it was
measured under (`echelles`): change a scale and the scores move with it.

Scenarios measured: `amount`, `velocity`, `structuring`, `round`, `zscore`, `passthrough`, `peer`. An eighth, learned scenario is named ABSENT from day one: it will come or it will not, it will never be guessed.

## Written cases (authored) — 42 suspicious, 42 benign

The set's value is its benign look-alikes: a payroll looks like rapid movement from afar.
Natures: structuring x7, rapid-movement x7, dormant-burst x7, round-tripping x7, cash-intensive x7, layering-fan-out x7, payroll x7, seasonal-trade x7, loan-repayment x7, rent-collection x7, savings-transfer x7, one-off-purchase x7.

## The cell the tool's own rule retains

No cell holds a recall lower bound of 90 % on the written cases: said, not hidden.

Generated by `npm run measure`; a sealed record refuses silent overwrite.
